HashTable Mask Dumper
=====================

This extension is a sample used in my "PHP Under the Hood" talk. The
purpose is to demonstrate engine internals. This is nothing anybody should
use for anything but educational purpose.

Be aware that the results shown by the sample script htmask.php are "wrong".
The sample works on a copy of the function table. This might have a
different table mask.
